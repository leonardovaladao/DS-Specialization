# DS-Specialization
Data Science at Scale Specialization, offered by the University of Washington

## About this Specialization
### Learn scalable data management, evaluate big data technologies, and design effective visualizations.

This Specialization covers intermediate topics in data science. You will gain hands-on experience with scalable SQL and NoSQL data management solutions, data mining algorithms, and practical statistical and machine learning concepts. You will also learn to visualize data and communicate results, and you’ll explore legal and ethical issues that arise in working with big data. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with the digital internship platform Coursolve, you’ll apply your new skills to a real-world data science project.
